# Quick Start

Get your first Chrome extension up and running in just a few minutes.

## Installation

The fastest way to get started is using npx, which will always use the latest version:

```bash
npx create-chrome-ext
```

You can also install it globally if you plan to create multiple extensions:

```bash
npm install -g create-chrome-ext
create-chrome-ext
```

## Creating Your First Extension

<Section>

When you run the command, you'll be prompted to:

1. **Enter a project name** - This will be the folder name for your extension
2. **Choose a template** - Select from Vanilla JS, React + Vite, or React + Next.js
3. **Configure additional options** - Such as enabling TypeScript (for React templates)

The tool will then:
- Create a new directory with your project name
- Install all necessary dependencies
- Set up the project structure
- Generate a complete `manifest.json` file

</Section>

## Development Workflow

<Section>

### Start the Development Server

Navigate to your project directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd my-extension
npm run dev
```

This will:
- Build your extension in development mode
- Watch for file changes
- Enable hot reload for supported templates

### Load the Extension in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle in the top-right corner
3. Click "Load unpacked" button
4. Select your project's build directory:
   - **Vanilla JS**: Select the root project folder
   - **React + Vite**: Select the `dist` folder
   - **React + Next.js**: Select the `out` folder

The extension will appear in your extensions list and be available for testing immediately.
</Alert>

</Section>

## Making Changes

<Section>

### Hot Reload

For React templates, changes to your code will automatically reload the extension. For Vanilla JS, you may need to manually reload the extension in Chrome.

### File Structure

Each template provides a different file structure, but they all include:

- `manifest.json` - Extension configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- Main entry files for your extension logic

### Testing Your Changes

After making changes:
1. The extension should reload automatically (React templates)
2. Or click the refresh button next to your extension (Vanilla JS)
3. Test your extension's functionality in Chrome

</Section>

## Building for Production

<Section>

When you're ready to package your extension:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized, production-ready build that you can:
- Upload to the Chrome Web Store
- Share with others
- Package as a `.crx` file

The build will be in the same directory as development (`dist`, `out`, or root folder).

</Section>

## Common Commands

<Section>

Every generated project includes these npm scripts:

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests (if available)
npm test

# Lint code (React templates)
npm run lint
```

</Section>
