# create-chrome-ext Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for create-chrome-ext. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know, from creating your first extension to understanding the details of your project's structure.

## Getting Started

create-chrome-ext is a command-line tool that allows you to generate a modern Chrome extension boilerplate in seconds. To get started, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-chrome-ext
```

The tool will guide you through a few simple prompts to name your project and select a template. Once it's finished, you'll have a complete, ready-to-run extension project.

### The Three-Step Process

1. **Run the Command**: Execute `npx create-chrome-ext` and follow the on-screen instructions.
2. **Start Developing**: Navigate into your new project folder (`cd my-app`) and run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
3. **Load in Chrome**: Open `chrome://extensions`, enable "Developer mode," and load the generated build folder (`dist` or `build`).

## Core Concepts

The primary goal of this tool is to eliminate the friction and repetitive setup involved in modern extension development. It handles the configuration so you can focus on building features.

<Section>

### Zero Configuration
All build tools, scripts, and manifest files are pre-configured and optimized for extension development.

### Modern Tooling
Use the frameworks you love, like React and Vite, in an environment that's set up for the specific constraints of browser extensions.

### Manifest V3 Ready
Every template is built to comply with the latest Manifest V3 standards, ensuring your extension is secure and future-proof.
